Version: 0.3.1
Date: 2026-01-02
  Bug Fix:
    - Last refactor broke the integration with constant combinators.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2025-12-18
  Bug Fix:
    - Properly compare signals with quality (previously ignored quality when matching signals.  
      May be breaking for some)
    - When reslecting blueprint contents, we referneced the original not the new contents.
  Internal update:
    - synced library functions for consideration of pulling out into shared mod
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.4
Date: 2025-12-12
  Bug Fixes:
    - When LHS is EVERYTHING and there is no signal on the specific wire decider combinator 
      treats this as everything is 0.  We now follow that convention.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.3
Date: 2025-11-30
  Minor Feature:
    - Left hand side of condition handles Each, Anything and Everything signals
    - Right hand side of condition Anything and Everything signals are disallowed. Each is only 
      allowed when Each is already set of the LHS.
    - Each will compare each signal for the condition and if ANY are true the condition will be true
      Probalby most beneficial comparing red to green, otehrwise Any or Every would be more suitable.
    - Having trouble with elem_chooser_button filter, so I can't hide the signal options, so 
      instead I generate a message if the disallowed signals are chosen and reset the button
