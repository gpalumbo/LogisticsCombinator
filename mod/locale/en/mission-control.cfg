[entity-name]
logistics-combinator=Logistics Combinator

[entity-description]
logistics-combinator=Dynamically injects and removes logistics groups based on circuit network conditions. Connect to logistics-enabled entities and configure rules to automate logistics requests.

[item-name]
logistics-combinator=Logistics Combinator

[item-description]
logistics-combinator=Dynamically injects and removes logistics groups based on circuit network conditions. Connect to logistics-enabled entities and configure rules to automate logistics requests.

[recipe-name]
logistics-combinator=Logistics Combinator

[technology-name]
logistics-circuit-control=Logistics Circuit Control

[technology-description]
logistics-circuit-control=Enables dynamic control of logistics groups using circuit networks. Unlocks the Logistics Combinator, which can automatically inject and remove logistics requests based on circuit conditions.

[logistics-combinator]
controlled-groups=Circuit-Controlled Logistics Groups
add-rule=+ Add Controlled Group
add-rule-tooltip=Add a new rule to control logistics groups based on circuit conditions. When the condition is TRUE, the group is injected. When FALSE, the group is removed.
delete-rule=Delete this rule
group-label=Group:
group-tooltip=Select the logistics group to control. The group will be injected when the condition is met, and removed when the condition is not met.
condition-label=When:
signal-tooltip=Select the circuit signal to check
operator-tooltip=Select the comparison operator
value-tooltip=Enter the value to compare against
active=ACTIVE
inactive=Inactive
status-tooltip=Shows whether this rule's condition is currently met (and the group is injected)
connected-entities=Connected logistics entities: __1__
input-signals=Current Input Signals
no-input-signals=No circuit connections detected
red-circuit=Red Circuit
green-circuit=Green Circuit
no-signals-on-network=Not connected

[gui]
close=Close
select-all=Select All
clear-all=Clear All
select-all-tooltip=Select all options
clear-all-tooltip=Clear all selections
condition-signal-tooltip=Select the signal to check
condition-operator-tooltip=Select the comparison operator
condition-value-tooltip=Enter the value to compare against (or leave as 0 for signal comparison)

[mod-name]
mission-control=Mission Control

[mod-description]
mission-control=Enables circuit network communication between planets and space platforms with dynamic logistics control. Control logistics groups via circuit conditions and coordinate ground-to-space automation.
