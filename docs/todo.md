## Development Guidelines

### Module Responsibilities (CRITICAL - READ FIRST!)
**📖 Before writing ANY code, consult `docs/module_responsibility_matrix.md`**

This document defines:
- What each module OWNS and DOESN'T OWN
- Decision criteria for where new functions belong
- Examples of correct/incorrect placement
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Dependency rules

**When adding a new function, use the decision tree in the matrix to determine correct placement.**

### Code Organization
- Keep individual .lua files under 750-900 lines
- Break large modules into sub-modules
- Use meaningful function and variable names
- Document all functions with inline comments
- Group related functions together

### Performance
- Prefer on_nth_tick over on_tick
- Cache expensive lookups
- Minimize global table traversals
- Use local variables for frequently accessed data
- Profile before optimizing

### Testing Strategy
- Test each phase independently before moving to next
- Create test scenarios in new game
- Test with existing saves
- Test multiplayer scenarios
- Test mod compatibility

### Version Control
- Commit after each completed phase
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Tag releases with version numbers
- Maintain changelog
