# Module Responsibility Matrix
## Single Source of Truth for Code Organization

This document defines EXACTLY what belongs in each module, what doesn't belong, and how to make decisions when it's ambiguous.

---

## Decision Framework

### The Golden Rules

1. **Stateless vs Stateful**
   - `lib/` modules = Pure functions, NO global state access
   - `scripts/` modules = Stateful logic, CAN access global tables

2. **Data vs Behavior**
   - `prototypes/` = Static definitions (data phase)
   - `lib/` & `scripts/` = Runtime behavior (control phase)

3. **Generic vs Specific**
   - `lib/` = Generic utilities usable by any entity type
   - `scripts/` = Entity-specific or cross-entity coordination logic

4. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - Each module owns ONE domain concept
   - If a function needs data from 2+ modules, it belongs in the coordination layer

## LIB Modules (Pure Utilities)

### lib/signal_utils.lua

**OWNS:**
- Signal table manipulation (add, merge, copy, compare, clear)
- Signal counting and statistics
- Signal table validation
- Signal formatting for display

**DOES NOT OWN:**
- Reading signals from entities (that's circuit_utils)
- Storing signals in global (that's entity scripts)
- Evaluating conditions (that's gui_utils)
- Entity-specific signal logic

**Decision Criteria:**
- ✅ "Does this operate on signal tables without knowing where they came from?" → signal_utils
- ❌ "Does this need to know about entities or circuit networks?" → circuit_utils
- ❌ "Does this need to store state?" → scripts/

**Examples:**
```lua
-- ✅ BELONGS HERE
function add_signals(target, source)  -- Pure table operation
function count_signals(signals)        -- Pure computation
function format_signal_for_display(signal_id, count)  -- Pure formatting

-- ❌ DOES NOT BELONG
function get_entity_signals(entity)    -- Uses entity → circuit_utils
function store_signals_for_later(...)  -- Stores state → scripts/
function evaluate_signal_condition(...) -- Business logic → gui_utils or entity script
```

---

### lib/circuit_utils.lua

**OWNS:**
- Reading signals from entity circuit connectors
- Writing signals to entity outputs
- Checking if entity has circuit connections
- Finding entities on circuit networks
- Circuit connector enumeration
- Entity circuit capability validation

**DOES NOT OWN:**
- Signal table operations (that's signal_utils)
- Entity placement validation (that's validation)
- Platform-specific logic (that's platform_utils)
- Global state access (that's scripts/)

**Decision Criteria:**
- ✅ "Does this interact with Factorio's circuit network API?" → circuit_utils
- ✅ "Does this query/modify entity circuit connections?" → circuit_utils
- ❌ "Does this manipulate signal tables after reading them?" → signal_utils
- ❌ "Does this validate entity placement?" → validation

**Examples:**
```lua
-- ✅ BELONGS HERE
function get_circuit_signals(entity, wire_type, connector_id)
function has_circuit_connection(entity, wire_type)
function get_connected_entities(circuit_network)

-- ❌ DOES NOT BELONG
function add_signals(target, source)   -- Pure table op → signal_utils
function validate_placement(entity)    -- Placement logic → validation
function is_platform_surface(surface)  -- Platform logic → platform_utils
```

---

### lib/platform_utils.lua

**OWNS:**
- Platform detection (is surface a platform?)
- Platform object retrieval
- Orbit status checking
- Platform movement state (stationary/traveling)
- Surface-platform relationship queries
- Platform enumeration

**DOES NOT OWN:**
- Receiver-specific logic (that's scripts/receiver_combinator)
- Signal transmission (that's scripts/network_manager)
- Global platform state storage (that's scripts/globals)
- Entity validation beyond platform checks

**Decision Criteria:**
- ✅ "Is this a query about platforms or space locations?" → platform_utils
- ✅ "Does this determine platform state without side effects?" → platform_utils
- ❌ "Does this act on platform state (send signals, update entities)?" → scripts/network_manager
- ❌ "Does this store platform data?" → scripts/globals

**Examples:**
```lua
-- ✅ BELONGS HERE
function is_platform_surface(surface)
function is_platform_orbiting(platform_id, surface_index)
function is_platform_stationary(platform)
function get_orbited_surface(platform)

-- ❌ DOES NOT BELONG
function update_receiver_connection(receiver_id)  -- State update → scripts/receiver_combinator
function send_signals_to_platform(...)            -- Action → scripts/network_manager
function register_receiver(entity)                 -- State storage → scripts/globals
```

---

### lib/validation.lua ⚠️ **DEPRECATED - OPTIONAL MODULE**

**⚠️ ARCHITECTURAL NOTE:** This module is **SUPERSEDED** by Factorio's native `TileBuildabilityRule` system (see `docs/tile_buildability_approach.md`). Tile buildability rules are defined in entity prototypes and provide superior performance, game integration, and simplicity.

**RECOMMENDED APPROACH:**
- Mission Control: Use `colliding_tiles = {"space-platform-foundation"}` in prototype
- Receiver Combinator: Use `required_tiles = {"space-platform-foundation"}` in prototype
- Logistics Combinator: No restrictions needed

**Current Status:** Module implemented but NOT imported by any scripts. Retained only for reference or optional custom error messages.

**ORIGINALLY OWNED (NOW HANDLED BY TILE RULES):**
- Entity placement validation (planet-only, platform-only)
- Placement error messages
- Entity refund logic
- Surface capability checking
- Player notification for placement errors

**DOES NOT OWN:**
- Entity registration after successful placement (that's scripts/globals)
- Circuit connection validation (that's circuit_utils)
- Rule/configuration validation (that's entity scripts)
- General error handling

**Decision Criteria (IF CUSTOM MESSAGES NEEDED):**
- ✅ "Is this about providing enhanced error feedback?" → validation (optional)
- ❌ "Is this about primary placement enforcement?" → Use tile_buildability_rules
- ❌ "Is this about what happens AFTER successful placement?" → scripts/
- ❌ "Is this about runtime behavior validation?" → entity scripts

**Examples:**
```lua
-- ✅ BELONGS HERE (if module is used)
function validate_mission_control_placement(entity, player)
function validate_receiver_placement(entity, player)
function refund_entity(entity, player, inventory)
function show_placement_error(player, message_key, position)

-- ❌ DOES NOT BELONG
function register_mc_building(entity)              -- Post-placement → scripts/globals
function validate_rule_condition(rule)             -- Runtime validation → scripts/logistics_combinator
function check_circuit_connection(entity)          -- Circuit check → circuit_utils
```

**NOTE:** In Phase 2+ implementation, tile_buildability_rules should be used instead of importing this module.

---

### lib/logistics_utils.lua

**OWNS:**
- Finding logistics-enabled entities on networks
- Checking if entity has specific logistics group
- Injecting logistics groups (the act of injection)
- Removing logistics groups (the act of removal)
- Logistics group capability detection
- Logistics section manipulation

**DOES NOT OWN:**
- Rule storage and evaluation (that's scripts/logistics_combinator)
- Tracking which combinator injected what (that's scripts/globals)
- Deciding WHEN to inject/remove (that's scripts/logistics_combinator)
- Connected entity caching (that's scripts/logistics_combinator)

**Decision Criteria:**
- ✅ "Is this a low-level logistics section operation?" → logistics_utils
- ✅ "Does this directly manipulate LuaLogisticSection?" → logistics_utils
- ❌ "Does this decide when/why to inject?" → scripts/logistics_combinator
- ❌ "Does this track injection history?" → scripts/globals

**Examples:**
```lua
-- ✅ BELONGS HERE
function inject_logistics_group(entity, group_template, combinator_id)
function remove_logistics_group(entity, group_name, combinator_id)
function has_logistics_group(entity, group_name)
function supports_logistics_control(entity)

-- ❌ DOES NOT BELONG
function process_logistics_rules(combinator_id)    -- Business logic → scripts/logistics_combinator
function track_injected_group(entity_id, ...)      -- State tracking → scripts/globals
function evaluate_condition(signals, condition)    -- Rule evaluation → scripts/logistics_combinator
```

**CRITICAL BOUNDARY:**
This module performs injections but doesn't track them in global. The entity script calls this module and then updates global state.

---

### lib/gui_utils.lua

**OWNS:**
- Generic GUI element creation (titlebar, buttons, flows)
- GUI layout helpers
- GUI positioning (centering, etc.)
- Condition selector UI creation (signal + operator + value)
- Operator dropdown population
- Condition evaluation (signal comparison logic)
- Operator conversion (symbol ↔ index)

**DOES NOT OWN:**
- Entity-specific GUI layouts (that's scripts/gui_handlers)
- GUI state storage (that's scripts/globals)
- GUI event handling (that's scripts/gui_handlers)
- Opening/closing GUIs for specific entities

**Decision Criteria:**
- ✅ "Is this a reusable GUI pattern used by multiple entity types?" → gui_utils
- ✅ "Is this GUI logic with no entity-specific knowledge?" → gui_utils
- ❌ "Is this specific to receiver/logistics combinator GUI?" → scripts/gui_handlers
- ❌ "Does this store GUI state?" → scripts/globals

**Examples:**
```lua
-- ✅ BELONGS HERE
function create_titlebar(parent, title, close_button_name)
function create_condition_selector(parent, name_prefix)
function evaluate_condition(signals, condition)    -- Generic signal comparison
function populate_operator_dropdown(dropdown)

-- ❌ DOES NOT BELONG
function create_receiver_gui(player, entity)       -- Entity-specific → scripts/gui_handlers
function on_gui_opened(event)                      -- Event handling → scripts/gui_handlers
function get_gui_state(player_index)               -- State access → scripts/globals
```

**SPECIAL NOTE:** `evaluate_condition` belongs here because it's generic signal comparison logic used by logistics combinators. It doesn't know about combinator-specific rules or state.

```

**CRITICAL PATTERN:**
```lua
-- This module provides:
global.mc_networks[surface_index] = {...}  -- STRUCTURE
function get_mc_network(surface_index)     -- ACCESSOR

function is_platform_orbiting(platform_id, ...)    -- Platform → lib/platform_utils
function update_transmissions()                    -- Coordination → scripts/network_manager
function register_mc_building(entity)              -- Registration → scripts/globals
```

**BOUNDARY WITH network_manager:**
- mission_control.lua: "What should the MC network output be?" (aggregation)
- network_manager.lua: "Send MC network to receivers" (transmission)

---

function relay_to_platform(unit_number, signals)  -- Transmission → scripts/network_manager
function create_receiver_gui(player, entity)      -- GUI → scripts/gui_handlers

```

**BOUNDARY WITH network_manager:**
- receiver_combinator.lua: "Is this receiver connected to planet X?" (status)

**OWNS:**
- Logistics combinator lifecycle (build/remove)
- Rule processing and evaluation
- Connected entity cache management
- Rule state tracking (edge detection)
- Rule execution coordination
- All logic specific to logistics combinators

**DOES NOT OWN:**
- Actual logistics injection/removal (calls lib/logistics_utils)

function evaluate_condition(signals, condition)    -- Generic → lib/gui_utils
function register_logistics_combinator(entity)     -- Registration → scripts/globals
```

**CRITICAL PATTERN:**
```lua
-- This module decides WHEN:
if rule_state_changed(rule, signals) then
  -- This module decides WHAT:
  if rule.action == "inject" then
    -- But delegates HOW to lib:
    logistics_utils.inject_logistics_group(entity, template, combinator_id)
    -- Then updates state:
    globals.track_injected_group(...)
  end
end
```

---

### scripts/network_manager.lua

**OWNS:**
- Cross-surface signal transmission coordination
- Ground-to-space signal flow
- Space-to-ground signal flow
- Platform connection state updates

function process_ground_to_space(surface_index)
function process_space_to_ground(surface_index)
function update_platform_connections()
function find_receivers_for_surface(surface_index)

-- ❌ DOES NOT BELONG
function update_mc_network(surface_index)         -- MC-specific → scripts/mission_control
function check_receiver_connection(unit_number)   // Receiver-specific → scripts/receiver_combinator
function add_signals(target, source)              -- Generic → lib/signal_utils
```

**COORDINATION ROLE:**
This module orchestrates entity scripts. It calls:
- `mission_control.get_mc_aggregated_signals()`
- `receiver_combinator.check_receiver_connection()`
- Then performs transmission between them

---

### scripts/gui_handlers.lua

function evaluate_condition(signals, condition)   -- Generic → lib/gui_utils
function add_logistics_rule(unit_number, rule)    -- State → scripts/globals
function process_logistics_rules(unit_number)     -- Logic → scripts/logistics_combinator
```

**PATTERN:**
```lua
-- This module handles events:
function on_logistics_add_rule(event)
  local rule = build_rule_from_gui(event)
  -- Delegates to globals for storage:
  globals.add_logistics_rule(unit_number, rule)
  -- Delegates to entity script for immediate processing:
  logistics_combinator.process_logistics_rules(unit_number)
  -- Updates GUI:

end
```

## Function Placement Checklist

Before adding a new function, ask:

1. **Does it access global state?**
   - NO → Consider `lib/`
   - YES → Must be in `scripts/`

2. **Does it operate on entities?**
   - YES, generic operations → `lib/circuit_utils` or `lib/platform_utils`
   - YES, entity-specific → appropriate entity script
   - NO → Other criteria

3. **Does it coordinate multiple systems?**
   - YES → `scripts/network_manager` or `scripts/gui_handlers`
   - NO → Single-responsibility module

4. **Is it reusable?**
   - YES → `lib/`
   - NO → `scripts/`

5. **Is it about data structure or business logic?**
   - Data structure → `scripts/globals`
   - Business logic → entity script

---

## Examples of Correct Placement

### Example 1: Adding a new signal formatting function
```lua
-- QUESTION: Format signal for tooltip display - where does it go?

-- ANALYSIS:
-- - Does it access global? NO
-- - Does it operate on entities? NO
-- - Is it reusable? YES
-- - Pure computation? YES

-- ANSWER: lib/signal_utils.lua
function format_signal_tooltip(signal_id, count)
  return string.format("%s: %d", signal_id.name, count)
end
```

### Example 2: Adding platform travel time estimation
```lua
-- QUESTION: Estimate travel time between surfaces - where does it go?

-- ANALYSIS:
-- - Does it access global? NO
// - Does it operate on platforms? YES, generic query
-- - Is it reusable? YES
-- - Pure computation using platform API? YES

-- ANSWER: lib/platform_utils.lua
function estimate_travel_time(platform, target_surface)
  -- Uses platform.space_location API
end
```

### Example 3: Adding rule priority system
```lua
-- QUESTION: Process rules in priority order - where does it go?

-- ANALYSIS:
-- - Does it access global? YES (reads rules)
-- - Specific to logistics combinator? YES
-- - Business logic? YES

-- ANSWER: scripts/logistics_combinator.lua
function process_rules_by_priority(unit_number)
  local data = globals.get_logistics_combinator_data(unit_number)
  -- Sort and process rules
end
```

### Example 4: Adding "Export Configuration" button
```lua
-- QUESTION: GUI button to export config to string - where does it go?

-- ANALYSIS:
-- - Is it a reusable GUI component? NO (specific to one entity)
-- - Is it event handling? YES
-- - Is it entity-specific? YES (logistics combinator)

-- ANSWER: scripts/gui_handlers.lua
function on_logistics_export_config(event)
  local config = build_config_from_combinator(...)
  -- Show export dialog
end
```

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ WRONG: Accessing global directly from lib/
```lua
-- lib/circuit_utils.lua
function get_all_mc_signals()
  for surface_index, network in pairs(global.mc_networks) do  -- NO!
    -- ...
  end
end
```
**WHY:** lib/ modules must be pure, no global access

**FIX:** Move to scripts/ or pass data as parameter

---

### ❌ WRONG: Entity-specific logic in generic util
```lua
-- lib/signal_utils.lua
function get_mission_control_signals(entity)  -- NO!
  -- This is entity-specific
end
```
**WHY:** signal_utils is for generic signal operations

**FIX:** Move to scripts/mission_control.lua

---

### ❌ WRONG: Business logic in globals
```lua
-- scripts/globals.lua
function register_mc_building(entity)
  -- ... registration ...
  update_mc_network(entity.surface.index)  -- NO! This is business logic
end
```
**WHY:** globals is for data access only, not processing

**FIX:** Caller handles registration AND update separately

---

### ❌ WRONG: Storing state in lib/
```lua
-- lib/platform_utils.lua
local platform_cache = {}  -- NO! State storage
```
**WHY:** lib/ modules must be stateless

**FIX:** Pass data as parameters or use scripts/globals

---

### ❌ WRONG: Low-level operations in high-level module
```lua
-- scripts/logistics_combinator.lua
function inject_group_directly(entity, template)
  local section = entity.logistic_sections.add_section(template)  -- NO!
  -- This is low-level, belongs in logistics_utils
end
```
**WHY:** Violates separation of concerns

**FIX:** Call lib/logistics_utils.inject_logistics_group()

---

## When to Create a NEW Module

Create a new lib/ module when:
1. You have 5+ related pure functions
2. They form a cohesive domain concept
3. They're reusable across multiple entity types
4. Existing modules would exceed 750 lines

Create a new scripts/ module when:
1. A new entity type is added
2. An existing module exceeds 750 lines
3. A distinct coordination responsibility emerges

**DO NOT create modules for:**
- Single functions (add to existing module)
- Temporary utilities (refactor later)
- Entity variations (extend existing entity module)

## Enforcement

**Code Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Function is in correct module per decision tree
- [ ] lib/ functions don't access global
- [ ] scripts/ functions use lib/ for generic operations
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Module stays under 750 lines
- [ ] Function documented with module rationale

**Naming Convention:**
- Module name clearly indicates responsibility
- Function names indicate domain (e.g., `signal_*`, `platform_*`)
- No generic names like `utils.lua` or `helpers.lua`
